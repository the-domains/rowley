Communion:

Anyone here specialize in forgetting? I forget my phone at home like once a week, when I walk into a room to get something I often forget what I was looking for, I forget where I put my keys, I forget my coffee mug at church, I forget passwords, I forget how to spell words to the point where I have to google it because spell check gave up on me, and embarrassingly enough I even forget how to spell my "legal" name!

Why do I forget things so quickly? Ask yourself the same question and I think you will find several factors.

* We lose focus and our minds drift elsewhere
* 
We lose the meaning or importance attached to what we doing
* 
We don't do something often enough for it to stay within our memory

This evening we are going to look at an aspect of Communion that the Corinthians had forgotten which was not just inconvenient or embarrassing but something that was sinful - something that grieved the Holy Spirit.

**Open **your bibles to 1 Cor. 11:23-34

**Context**

The Corinthian believers' had forgotten the purpose of the Lord's Supper---they were missing the point of the meal, (remember/celebrating Christ's sacrifice of love). It had only been about 5 years since Paul started this church and they had already forgotten the purpose of the Lord's supper.

It has been over 2000 since Christ has ascended. Is there a chance that we have forgotten some aspect of the true purpose of communion?

The Corinthian believers were hindering their relationships with other believers by not waiting and sharing the food with those who had to work later and thus limiting the spread of the gospel (especially among the poor). They weren't displaying the love of God that they were claiming existed in the gospel.

Paul used several phrases to describe their behavior earlier in Ch. 11

**Pay attention to the emotion included in each verse:**

* vs17 When you get together it is for the worse not the better
* vs18-19 You are creating divisions
* Vs20 You don't celebrate communion - you eat your own meal
* vs20 You make some go away hungry
* vs22 Do you despise the Church of God?
* vs22 You humiliate those who have nothing

Their forgetfulness was causing a lot of hurt

When we partake in communion do we celebrate communion the way Jesus wants us to? Does our selfishness ever hurt other believers?

* Like our tendency to stick with our familiar friends instead of going out of our way to get to know someone who is new.

For many of us, the part of our relationship with God we often neglect is confession and repentance. Because, lets be honest it is much easier to praise God or make requests than it is to let him point out sin.

Confession or self-examination is mandated in vs 28, least we participate in an unworthy manor (vs27). Let Communion serve as an opportune time for us to reflect and ask God to bring scripture to mind to convict our hearts of sin so that we may repent and may live more faithfully to the calling we have received. 

**As we read the text together:**

* You may be thinking to yourself, why all this fuss about not sharing at a church potluck? Is it really that big of a deal?
* There is no such thing as a small or insignificant sin. **As if **God looks at our sin and says, "Oh that's fine everyone does it, or I'll look the other way because it was a silly rule anyway."
* All sin is offensive to God but we rarely act like it. (gluttony, gossip, selfishness)
* The Corinthians' sin composed of disobeying God's most important command to love your neighbor as yourself, they were being divisive or causing disputes with those less fortunate then they, and perhaps most offensively treating Jesus' sacrifice flippantly. 
* Communion is our opportunity to remember that blood had to be shed - life was demanded for our wickedness.

**Read: 1 Cor. 11:23-34**

23 For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me." 25 In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me." 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.

27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. 28 Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. 30 That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. 31 But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. 32 But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.

33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another--- 34 if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home---so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. 

About the other things I will give directions when I come.

* In Part of Paul's rebuke to the Corinthians Paul chooses to bring up the story of the Last Supper Jesus had with the disciples. He wanted them to remember the why. __
* That is why we may, "_proclaim the Lord's death till he comes again."_

- \> Understanding the WHY Helps you obey and remember

**Punishment or Discipline**

* With the why out of the way Paul launches into the _consequences _that occur when you choose to be disobedient to God.
  * What is implied is - that sin is serious to God.
  * Sin is serious to God so we see the outcome of sin in the body in -vs. 30 we have believers Suffering illness, Weakness, and even Death

* Now **is **this a picture of a mean old man throwing thunder bolts from the sky? NO it is a picture of a loving father enacting discipline.
* To all the parents out there: Is it fun spanking your child? Sending them to their room?Discipline is done for their good. Right??

* Vs 32 says "so that we may not be condemned along with the rest of the world" This is discipline not judgement -
* IT's Discipline with the purpose to invoke repentance. To get us to realize our fault and turn back to Jesus. Restoration is always God's intent for the believer.
* Good News vs.31 If we are discerning we can save ourself much trouble/hardship because God won't have to get our attention through discipline.
    * Jonah - God sent him to the Ninavites
    * Josiah avoided God's discipline in his life time because of his own self-examination.
      * 2 Kings 22:19-20
      * _(God Speaking) 19 because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the Lord, when you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the Lord. 20 Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place.'"_

May we not learn the hard way like Jonah but be like Josiah who heard the word of God and humbled himself and repented.

So how do we **Examine ourselves ****And Confess sin **for sin vs 28 1st

* **Understand **that all sin can fall into two categories: sin of Commission and Omission.
  * Commission: Choosing to do what is wrong
    * Cheating
    * rebelling against authorities
    * Cursing
    * Slandering
    * Complaining
  * Omission: When you refuse to do the good you know you should.
    * Loving your neighbor as yourself
    * Serving the least of these
    * Not sharing the gospel
  * Either of these can be done in ignorance but it still qualifies as sin.
    * So God doesn't put up with the excuse of, "Oh, I didn't know any better."
    * Turn to Luke 12:47 _That servant who _**_knows his master's will_**_and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants (_**_Co&Om_**_) will be beaten with many blows. But the one who _**_does not know (ignorance)_**_and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows_.

Understanding the categories of sin then helps you with the next step in self-examination

* **Ask questions **about key areas in your life. Church, Bible study/reading, prayer, witnessing, social interactions, family, finances, marriage, purity, use of abilities, use of time, physical health, work, school, and others.
  * **Exs**:
    * How have your relationships with others been affected by your working/school work?
    * How has your lack of self-control shown up in these areas - finances?
    * How has your pattern of deceit affected your friends/family?
    * How has your desire to get versus your desire to give affected your view of serving others or spending time with God?
  * The answers you are looking for are scripture. Not your conscience or a small quiet voice
  * So Let God bring scripture to mind as you are raising the questions up to him.
    * John 14:26 _But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and__bring to your remembrance__all that I have said to you._

**Practice****Examination**:

Everyone take a moment and think of a sin that you struggle turning away from.

Because many of you may be tempted to think you are close to Saint hood let me give you some examples:

* A thoughtless unkind word, a selfish act, a prideful thought, a moment of envy, a flash of lust, rebelliousness against a boss, an attitude of vengeance/spite, a minor moment of greediness, demanding recognition, failing to give grace where grace is needed, acting in bitterness instead of forgiveness, bending the truth, giving in to an addiction, or working to make these kinds of things (sin) in your life not look as bad as they actually are.

Ok I hope you have one now. - 

**Conviction **of sin means God has made that sin feel heavy and dirty. An infinite number of baths cannot make you clean nor can reasoning it away make the weight any lighter. The sin actually becomes an infectious pain that begins to weave itself down in your soul till all you can think about is how terrible you are.

**Confession and Repentance**

So what do we do after we have been convicted by either self-examination or God's discipline?

* dmit you have disobeyed God and are guilty of punishment
* Hate the sin
* Ask God for forgiveness
* Turn your heart away from sin to righteousness
  * Ex. Thief is to be generous (Eph. 4:28)
* Be specific don't just slip in a quick general prayer, "Father forgive me for all my sin, amen." 
  * The more specific you are the better the HS can work on your heart
* Preparing ahead of Communion is helpful 
  * IN **Matt. 5:24 **Jesus tells the Jews to leave their offering - presumably for their sin at the alter and return home to reconcile. Jesus is telling us that worship or confession is more meaningful when we are working toward reconciliation with godly sorrow
* What I mean when I say **godly sorrow **is the type of sorrow that leads us towards repentance (straight out of 2 Cor. 7:10).
* _For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death._
* In Matt 5:24, the man who has caused an offense is going beyond just admitting it was wrong (sacrifice in the temple) he is pursuing a right relationship with the person he offended (reconciliation). This is evidence that you are genuinely sorry for what you have done.
* 2 Cor. 7 continues: Godly grief produces eagerness to clear yourselves.
* So you are not just sorry you got caught; you are filled with grief to the point where you have a heart change (repent) and desire to restore that which you violated.

**What is not Confession**

* **1st **Prove to God that you are good enough or worthy enough to receive his forgiveness
  * I'm sorry I will do better next time: as if that will pay for your previous sins
  * Ps49:7-8 _Truly no man can ransom another,   
or give to God the price of his life,  
8 for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice_
* **2nd **Looking the part (having worldly sorrow) but not having godly sorrow (2 Cor. 7:10)
  * This is Faking sorrow so you can get off with the least amount of consequences.-You would do it again in a heart beat.
* **3rd **Believing you can judge others while expecting pardon or forgiveness from God
  * (Rom. 2:1) For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.
  * How can you expect God to display his forgiveness to you when you confess and not forgive your neighbor?

**Reflection**

* Practicing confession and repentance doesn't mean you become a Christian over and over again.
* Practicing confession and repentance for the Christian is remembering the body that was broken for us. It is remembering the blood that was shed for the forgiveness of our sins.
  * Its a Payment that demanded A life. A Payment that brought us life. 
* Practicing confession and repentance for the Christian helps us reconcile our relationship with Jesus just as he wants us to reconcile the relationship with others in Matthew 5\.
  * As Christians there is not a sin we can commit that God's grace can't cover - but like any relationship an offense stifles intimacy. The offense needs to be reconciled.
  * Reconciling our relationship with God isn't anything less than us putting Jesus first in our lives. Isn't sin the process of us placing things above God?
  * Picture repentance as once again acknowledging who is the real authority in your life.
* What I like about having times of self examination isn't the humiliation of admitting how sinful I can be and the chance to practice humility. What I actually enjoy about self examination is the refreshed appreciation at just how merciful and loving my God is.

* Every time I go to God with the purpose of confession I see the total inability I have to get to heaven and the desperate need I have for a Savior to pull me up from the sticking pitt of despair I have thrown myself into.
* I see a Savior who willingly bled out, so I could be clean
* I see a wretch whom God adopted. - in accordance to his pleasure! (Eph.1:5)
* I see an unending ocean of love that stretches father than I can grasp
* I see the Faithfulness of my God despite my betrayal and unfaithfulness
* I see the love of God in sending his son for me despite my lack of love for him/others
* In short I am in AWE of my God. Such awe that it leads me to worship. Worship one who is so much greater and purer than I.
  * What is it that you see?

* I gain humility - right view of myself. Dust and ashes that have been forged into a costly treasure by the blood of the lamb.
* I gain intimacy with my father as I learn to say abba and call upon him for help as Paul did.
* What is it that you gain?

We can forget a lot of things, from keys, to names, to phones. Let us not forget God's purposes - especially his purpose in sending his son Jesus. When we do Communion may we not forget God's purposes in giving us this celebration least it just become an empty tradition like it did with the Corinthians.

**In Summary**

: I am asking you to remember 4 things:

1. Remember the importance of Communion - his sacrifice
2. 
Remember Sin is serious
3. 
Remember to Practice self-examination
4. 
Remember to Confess and repent of sin

* For all the believers here, during Communion go over these 4 things. Let the Holy Spirit work on your heart with scripture.
